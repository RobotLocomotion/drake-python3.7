drake-python3.7
===============

A fork of the [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) toolbox for model-based design
and verification for robotics that uses Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic
Beaver) instead of Python 3.6 and pip to manage Python dependencies instead of
APT and Bazel.

Whenever possible, please use the code and binaries located in the
[drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake) repository.
